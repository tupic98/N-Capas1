                    <h2>Tippman X7 Phenom </h3>
                        <p>
                            Badassery? Is that even a word? Who knows, but it certainly sums up this top tier paintball marker. Like the A5, the X7 Phenom is insanely customizable and a common sight in simulation game types. The tactical visual upgrades look fantastic sitting atop the lightweight frame and it comes equipped with a mechanical single shot, but you can upgrade to the eGrip which has full auto, 3 round burst and single shot fire modes. 

Another cool e-grip feature: if the battery dies mid game, you can still switch to single shot which is powered by propellant, keeping you in the fight. switching the gun to safe mode also turns off the internal circuitry to save battery power. This gun is deadly accurate over medium-long range and great for woodsball players, and the light frame combined with a compact body kit makes it perfect for close quarters Recball/scenario play. While the price point is significantly higher than the standard 98 custom, it has a well earned place in the hearts of many advanced level players, and one of the best Tippmann markers on the market.

                    <h2>Tippmann US Army Project Salvo</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Tippmann Project Salvo is definitely one of the coolest looking guns we have gotten our hands on, and one of our favorites for woodsball and indoor rec-ball games. This marker is great for those who want a realistic looking gun and love to play simulation games. This thing just looks badass and always get compliments from other players.

                            You can find the project salvo bundled with a red dot sight, collapse-able rear stock and front grip, which makes it extremely versatile for whatever game type you happen to be playing. Combine it with the fantastic cyclone feed system and you have an exceptional paintball marker to dominate the field. These accessories give it a bit of extra weight which could be a good or bad thing depending on your preference, but it adds to the simulation element and we like it. Thanks to to longer barrel, accuracy is pretty good. While you wont be shooting tight groupings like the high end Dye or Empire markers, it is more than accurate enough for non tournament play. If you are looking for a great looking gun that can kick some ass, the Tippmann Project Salvo is a great choice.

                    <h2>Tippman Alpha Black Elite</h3>
                        <p>
                            Empire is the other high end paintball marker brand that consistently puts out amazing quality equipment. The Empire Mini really lives up to the name, it is hands down one of the smallest paintball guns on the market. This makes it extremely light weight and easy to control. The electronic trigger system makes it quiet and able to shoot as fast as you can pull the trigger.

The 2 handle design is comfortable and the included pressure gauge on the air connector is a nice touch, allowing you to quickly check the remaining air in your tank at a quick glance. This is a great entry level tournament style paintball marker and given the smaller size, quick rate of fire and overall accuracy, great for close quarters indoor play.

                    <h2>Tippmann TMC</h3>
                        <p>
                            The TMC in a way isn’t a new gun for Tippmann, it is rather a mag fed version of the Cronus. The Cronus is a wildly popular gun for Tippmann, since its release it has been Tippmann’s best selling gun and for good reason. The Cronus is a very well built and affordable paintball gun and the TMC looks to be no different.

                            The build quality is excellent, the ergonomics are comfortable and the magazines are great.

                            The whole point of the TMC is to capture the player that is new to magazine fed or grab that new paintball player that likes the versatility of the TMC.
                            
                            The TMC might just be the perfect starter paintball gun, because of its versatility. You can use the TMC in mag fed mode with the stock and gasblock or you could use the hopper adapter and take the stock and gasblock off to create a more traditional lightweight paintball gun setup.
                            
                            Having the ability to use the TMC in many different situations and its stellar build quality is what makes the TMC stand out against its competition.
